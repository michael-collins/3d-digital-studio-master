## Instructions

 1. Watch the tutorials.
 2. Create a polygonal model a quadruped (four-footed animal) from scratch. I suggest a variation of a cat or dog.
 3. Use the Rigify add-on to add an animal rig.
 4. Generate or create the relevant IK/FK bone constraints and controllers.
 5. Make sure you adjust and paint vertex weights to create pleasing deformation.
 6. Create an animated walk cycle for the animal.
 7. Set up a camera to frame the shot.
 8. To create a video of the viewport’s animation, save the file and set the render settings output folder to the project folder. Under **File Format**, choose **FFMpeg Video**, change the encoding format to **MPEG-4**.
 9. Choose **View** ⟶ **Viewport Render Animation** to create the animation.
10. Save as **_LASTNAME_-animal-rig-animation_.zip_** and upload to the submission dropbox.
11. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened. This should include:
    * `.blend` file
    * `.mp4` video file
