## Instructions

 1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
 2. Continue working from your model.
 3. Duplicate the sculpting assignment folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
 4. If you have not done so, retopologize the mesh.
 5. Unwrap the chair’s parts’ UVs using the various methods and tools described in the tutorials.
 6. Export a UV map and name it **_LASTNAME-uv-creature.png_**. If you have more than one UV map per object, use a logical naming scheme.
 7. Import the UV maps into Photoshop and create the color map.
 8. Create two maps: A **color map** and a **normal map**.
 9. Follow the **Normal Maps** and **Nodes** tutorial to connect the textures to the creature’s shader.
10. Save your diffuse map in the project folder as **_LASTNAME-creature-color.png_**.
11. Save your normal map in the project folder as **_LASTNAME-creature-normal.png_**.
12. In Blender, set up the textures so they are visible on the model.
13. Save the 3D scene file as **_LASTNAME_-texturing-objects** in the project folder.
14. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-texturing-objects.zip.**
15. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
16. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
