## Useful tips and links for rendering Blender animation projects

Rendering can take a very long time depending on your scene's complexity, the number of shots you have to render, whether you've optimized your scene or not, etc.

If you have more than one computer available to use, it's best to split the rendering task into separate frame ranges. If all computers are equally performant, you can equally divide the number of frames you have by the number of computers. Open the scene up on each computer, set the frame range in the render settings, and run the renders. If you have access to a computer lab, at night they are typically empty, so you can spit the frames up by as many computers as there are available. 720 frames divided by 20 computers equals 36 frames per computer. If it takes 3 minutes per frame to render, that would be 108 minutes
